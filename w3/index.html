                            Hello world, and welcome to my page. I"m a 33 year old East Providence resident, and have been one for most of my life. I am currently enrolled in Video Game Design and Development at New England Institute of Technology. This will be my second degree from the school. Just last year I graduated with an Associates degree as a Physical Therapist Assistant, and also received 'Best of Tech' and 'Tech Scholar' upon graduating. I also graduated from MTTI's Personal Fitness Trainer program, and became certified through the American College of Sports Medicine. This was all made possible through the GI Bill I earned while serving in the United States Coast Guard. During my time serving, I was stationed in New Hampshiere and Maine. During that time, I was on a boat that traveled from Canada, down to Columbia, and everywhere inbetween.
        
       I'm an only child but my cousins are like the siblings I never had. I usually spend my free time just trying to relax. My hobbies include working out, playing video games, writing, and when the mood strikes: drawing. I also started playing the drums late last year, and I love it. Finding the time to practice however hasn't been easy. I"m the type of person who likes to set goals for myself and then pursue them, so I know I will get better in due time. I'll just end this with some random trivia about myself. My favorite color is red. I have a cat named Langston. Also, I'm a foodie who likes to try new foods for the first time. That is about it. Thanks for coming to my page, and expect more content from me soon.

                            <li>Working out. I used to do powerlifting and strognman type training, but that is on the back burner now. However I still enjoy lifting. Running is something I dont enjoy so much. However, I ran my first half marathon distance last year. I was ready to run my first race this year, but sadly Covid hit.</li>
                            <li>Video games. I have enjoyed playing video games since I was a little kid. My uncle called me a 'Video Game Junkie'. I can see why he would. The first game I ever recall playing was an old dungeon crawling Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle game. However the passion came once I was intoduced to Sonic The Hedgehog on Sega Genesis. Ever since then, games have been a staple of my life. My favorite genre is RPGs, including titles like Final Fantays 7, 9, and 11. Deus Ex, and Mass Effect are also some of my favorites...though not true RPGs, they are heavy on RPG elements.</li>
                            <li>Drawing and writing. I used to draw so much when I was younger, but dont as much anymore. However I am aimming to get back into it. By the time I graduated high school, I had five strong story concepts under my belt that I hope to pitch some day. One of my most proudest days was when I made zerox copies of a the first full fledge comic I ever made. I went home 22 dollars richer, after selling it for 2 dollars a piece. I also adore character design, it is my favorite. Tetsuya Nomura and Kubo Tite are my heroes when it comes to this.</li>
                            <li>Drumming. Its a newer hobby. However, the faster the song, the better. There is constant battle among drummers about jazz vs rock, and which is harder to play. I'm not expercienced enough to say just yet, but I know I love the challenge of fast rock songs. </li>
                            <li>Movies. I am a movie buff, and I absolutely miss going to the cinemas. I had two different movie subscriptions and would go once a week to find a good movie to watch. MCU movies are my personal favorite. Being a comic reader when I was younger, it was so hard to find people to talk to about my favorite characters. Nowadays, everyone and their mom knows who Thanos is. <i>It blows my mind.</i> </li>
